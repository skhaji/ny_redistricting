2020 Redistricting Data for New York at the Block, County, Minor Civil Division (MCD), State, and Voting Tabulation District (VTD) levels (with and without DOJ categories)

Legislative Law section 83-m directed the Task Force to adjust the Census for state and local redistricting purposes by removing Federal and State incarcerated individuals from where they were incarcerated on April 1, 2020. State incarcerated individuals were re-assigned to their residence of record prior to incarceration. Federal incarcerated individuals were subtracted from the state total and are not re-assigned. In accordance with this law, the Task Force will use these adjusted data in the creation of new State Senate and State Assembly districts.

Do NOT use the 2020 Amended Population file for Congressional redistricting. Use the 2020 unadjusted Census data files.
